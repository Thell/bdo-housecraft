# About

This project is an implementation of the pop_jump_push algorithm. It uses graph data from the MMORPG Black Desert Online's town building networks, which provide
varying graph sizes and multistate nodes, to generate and score exact solutions to the problem of minimizing cost while maximizing utilization given minimum usage levels.

In Black Desert Online the map is split into regions, each region consists of towns and the towns have buildings in chains where a building can be required to be rented prior to another building in the chain (an arborescence). The buildings can be used for many purposes and this project only concerns itself with worker lodging and warehouse storage.

# Building Information

> **Note: Calpheon City, Valencia City and Heidel are _not_ included in the exact results.**

## List building chains.

When one chain can provide the same or more lodging/storage for less or the same cost it is said to 'dominate' another chain. Multiple chains can be dominant for a cost such that one may have more or less lodging/storage than the other but both have the same or more than the requested counts.

# Generate building chains.

- Exhaustively calculates exact node chain costs for warehouse and workers.
- Data is written to a file `/data/housecraft/{region_name}.json` containing storage, lodging, building and usage states sorted by warehouse and worker count in ascending order.

## Generation/Optimization Notes

Even though the generator visits _all_ combinations of all buildings in all states and the optimizer visits all combinations of storage and lodging they both yield only the dominating chains.

> A dominant chain strictly dominates a different chain when it provides the same or more workers and or warehouse counts for less or the same cost.

The resulting chains are the best-of-the-best chains for any combination of cost, worker and warehouse counts.

All of the following regions have had exact results generated: Ancado Inner Harbor, Arehaza, Duvencrune, Eilton, Glish, Gr√°na, Iliya Island, Keplan, Muiquun, O'draxxia, Old Wisdom Tree, Olvia, Port Epheria, Sand Grain Bazaar, Shakatu, Tarif, Trent, Velia, and Altinova.

The exact results validated the results of the both the Python implmentated optimizer using CBC and the Rust implemented optimizer using HiGHS with 100% matches. Then both implementations optimized the regions of Heidel, Valencia City and Calpheon City with only a single resulting difference. That difference was on an instance that would never happen in reality; it utilized 6 lodging, and either 399 or 400 storage slots both with a cost of 152.

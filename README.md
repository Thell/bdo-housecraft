# About

This project is an implementation of the pop_jump_push algorithm. It uses graph
data from the MMORPG Black Desert Online's town building networks, which provide
varying graph sizes and multistate nodes, to generate and score exact solutions
to the problem of minimizing cost while maximizing utilization given minimum
usage levels.

In Black Desert Online the map is split into regions, each region consists of
towns and the towns have buildings in chains where a building can be required to
be rented prior to another building in the chain (an arborescence). The
buildings can be used for many purposes and this project only concerns itself
with worker lodging and warehouse storage.

# Required input files

The following files are required in `\data\houseinfo\`:
- `houseinfo.json` describes the properties of houses. is a dictionary but the keys are not used. each value describes a house and must contain all of the following fields:
  - `need_explore_point: <integer>` the CP cost of the house
  - `affiliated_town: <townkey>` which region the house belongs to
  - `parent_node: <nodekey>` required but unused
  - `character_key: <charkey>` is the actual key to perform linking
  - `len_need_house_key` either 1 if the house has a requirement, or 0 if not
  - `need_house_key` either a `charkey` of a required house, or 0
  - `house_group` required but unused
  - `house_floor` required but unused
  - `craft_list` a list of possible uses. each use must have fields:
	- `item_craft_index: <houseusekey>` the intended use, where 1 is lodging and 2 is storage
    - `house_level: <integer>` the "level" of usage. the level defines the amount of lodging (level 1: 1 bed, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 6, 5: 8) or storage (level 1: 3 storage cells, 2: 5, 3: 8, 4: 12, 5: 16) the house can give. this mapping is not configurable.
  - `num_craft_list_items` the length of `craft_list`
- Localization strings (use UTF8 for entries like Gr√°na). First line must contain `Param0,String` header, following lines are just `key,value`:
  - `Region.csv` - names of regions (`townkey`s)
  - `Exploration.csv` - names of nodes (`nodekey`s)
  - `Character.csv` - names of houses (`charkey`s)
  - `HouseInfoReceipe.csv` - human readable decriptions of "house use" integers (`houseusekey`s)
- `regioninfo.json` must contain a dictionary of regions to work on (`{<townkey>: name, ...}`, names are not used)

Use `/python/regenerate_houseinfo_data.py` as guidance for preparing the input files yourself.
	

# Building Information

## List building chains.

When one chain can provide the same or more lodging/storage for less or the same cost it is said to 'dominate' another chain. Multiple chains can be dominant for a cost such that one may have more or less lodging/storage than the other but both have the same or more than the requested counts.

## Generation/Optimization Notes

Even though the generator visits _all_ combinations of all buildings in all
states and the optimizer visits all combinations of storage and lodging they
both yield only the dominating chains.

> A dominant chain strictly dominates a different chain when it provides the
same or more workers and or warehouse counts for less or the same cost.

The resulting chains are the best-of-the-best chains for any combination of
cost, worker and warehouse counts.

All regions except Heidel, Valencia City and Calpheon City have had exact
results generated.

The exact results validated the results of the both the Python implmentated
optimizer using CBC and the Rust implemented optimizer using HiGHS with 100%
matches. Then both CBC and HiGHS optimized the regions of Heidel, Valencia City
and Calpheon City with only a single resulting difference.
That difference was on an instance that would never happen in reality; it
utilized 6 lodging, and either 399 or 400 storage slots both with a cost of 152
when the maximum usable lodging in-game is 192 per region.
